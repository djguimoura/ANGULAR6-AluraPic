This is a database of all mime types.
It consists of a single, public JSON file and does not include any logic,
allowing it to remain as un-opinionated as possible with an API.
It aggregates data from the following sources:

- http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml
- http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types
- http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/raw-file/default/conf/mime.types

## Installation

```bash
npm install mime-db
```

### Database Download

If you're crazy enough to use this in the browser, you can just grab the
<<<<<<< HEAD
JSON file using [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/). It is recommended to replace
`master` with [a release tag](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db/tags) as the
JSON format may change in the future.

## Usage

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
var db = require('mime-db');

// grab data on .js files
var data = db['application/javascript'];
=======
var db = require('mime-db')

// grab data on .js files
var data = db['application/javascript']

```

## Data Structure

The JSON file is a map lookup for lowercased mime types.
Each mime type has the following properties:

- `.source` - where the mime type is defined.
    If not set, it's probably a custom media type.
    - `apache` - [Apache common media types](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types)
    - `iana` - [IANA-defined media types](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)
    - `nginx` - [nginx media types](http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/raw-file/default/conf/mime.types)
- `.extensions[]` - known extensions associated with this mime type.
- `.compressible` - whether a file of this type can be gzipped.
- `.charset` - the default charset associated with this type, if any.

If unknown, every property could be `undefined`.

<<<<<<< HEAD
To edit the database, only make PRs against `src/custom.json` or
`src/custom-suffix.json`.

The `src/custom.json` file is a JSON object with the MIME type as the keys
and the values being an object with the following keys:

- `compressible` - leave out if you don't know, otherwise `true`/`false` for
  if the data represented by the time is typically compressible.

- `extensions` - include an array of file extensions that are associated with
  the type.
- `notes` - human-readable notes about the type, typically what the type is.
- `sources` - include an array of URLs of where the MIME type and the associated
  extensions are sourced from. This needs to be a [primary source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source);

### Adding Custom Media Types
>>>>>>> 34c640d (publish final version project alurapic)

The best way to get new media types included in this library is to register
them with the IANA. The community registration procedure is outlined in
[RFC 6838 section 5](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838#section-5). Types
registered with the IANA are automatically pulled into this library.

=======
If that is not possible / feasible, they can be added directly here as a
"custom" type. To do this, it is required to have a primary source that
definitively lists the media type. If an extension is going to be listed as
associateed with this media type, the source must definitively link the
media type and extension as well.
